<h2>Artificial intelligence in the corporate sky</h2>


AI technology improves enterprise performance and productivity by automating processes or tasks that once required manpower. AI can also understand data on a scale that no human can achieve. This ability can bring significant benefits to business. For example, Netflix uses machine learning to provide a level of personalization that helped the company grow its customer base by more than 25 percent in 2017.

Most companies have made data science a priority and are still investing heavily in it. According to a Gartner survey of more than 3,000 CIOs, respondents ranked analytics and business intelligence as the best distinguishing technology for their organizations. The CEOs surveyed see these technologies as the most strategic for their companies and, therefore, they attract the most new investment.

What are the driving factors for the adoption of artificial intelligence?
 
 1_It provides easy and affordable high-performance computing. The abundance of business computing power in the cloud has enabled easy access to affordable high-performance computing. Prior to this development, the only computing environments available for AI were non-cloud-based and expensive.

2_Having large amounts of data available for learning. AI needs to learn from a lot of data to make correct predictions. The emergence of different tools for collecting disaggregated data, in addition to the ability for organizations to easily and affordably store and process this data, both structural and unstructured data, has led to more organizations being able to create and train AI algorithms.

3_Applied AI technology provides a competitive advantage. Companies are increasingly realizing the competitive advantage of applying AI insights to business goals and making them a business-wide priority. For example, targeted recommendations provided by AI technology can help make better decisions faster. The many features and capabilities of AI can lower costs, reduce risks, speed up time to market, and more.
