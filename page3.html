<h2>representation of knowledge</h2>



Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to AI research. Many of the problems that machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge of the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, taxonomic groups, and relationships between objects; situations, events, countries, and time; causes and consequences; Knowing knowledge (what we know about what people know) and many other under-researched areas. The complete representation of "what is there" is called ontology (a word borrowed from ancient philosophy), and the most comprehensive of these are called super-ontologies.

Hypothetical thinking and qualification problem
Much of what people know are "assumptions". For example, when birds are mentioned in a conversation, the human brain usually paints an image of an animal the size of a fist, sings, and flies. Of course, not all of these specifications apply to all birds. John McCarthy defined this problem in 1969 as the qualifications problem: for every logical rule that AI researchers are interested in representing, there are many exceptions. There is almost nothing that can simply be said to be true or not in the manner required by abstract reasoning. Artificial intelligence research has revealed a number of solutions to this problem.

The breadth of logical knowledge
The average person knows a large number of facts about the atom. Research projects that seek to build a complete base of logical knowledge (such as Cyc) require massive amounts of ontological engineering -- they must be built in a traditional way where complex concepts are built one by one. One of the main goals is for a computer to understand a plurality of concepts to be able to learn by reading resources such as the Internet, and thus to be able to add to its ontology.

The symbolic subform of some logical knowledge
Much of what people know is not represented by "facts" or "data" to speak of. For example, someone with chess experience avoids a certain position because it is "exposed or unsafe" and an art critic realizes that a statue is fake at one glance. These are axioms or tendencies that are represented in the brain unconsciously and semi-symbolic. Such knowledge supports and provides context, for conscious symbolic knowledge. As with the problem of semi-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that AI or computational intelligence research will provide means to represent this type of knowledge.

planning
Intelligent agents must be able to set and achieve goals. They need a way of envisioning the future (it must have the ability to represent the condition of human beings in this world, and to be able to predict how much they will be able to change it), and to be able to choose to maximize the usefulness (or "value") of available options.

In some planning problems, the intelligent worker can assume that he is the only thing working in the world and can become certain of the consequences of his actions. Nevertheless, if this is not true, the worker must periodically check that his expectations are consistent with reality, and must change his plan when necessary. This requires that the worker work under uncertainty.

The UAE ranked first in the Middle East and 19 globally in the 2019 Artificial Intelligence Government Readiness Index, which includes 194 countries

A report issued by the Oxford Insight Foundation, with the support of the Canadian-based International Development Research Center, said that artificial intelligence technologies are expected to add $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

The UAE scored 7.445 in the index, while Singapore, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States of America and Finland ranked first in the world, according to the index.
