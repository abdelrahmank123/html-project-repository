<h2>1_narrow artificial intelligence</h2>

It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one field, for example, there are artificial intelligence systems that can beat the world champion in the game of chess, which is the only thing they do.

<h2>2_artificial general intelligence</h2>

This type refers to computers with the level of human intelligence in all fields, that is, it can perform any intellectual task that a person can perform. Creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type and we have not reached this level yet.

<h2>3_Super Artificial Intelligence<</h2>

Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as “thought far smarter than the best human minds in nearly every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills,” and because of this type the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting area to delve into.

artificial intelligence problems:The problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been divided into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of specific traits or capabilities that researchers would like to embody in an intelligent system. The features listed below have received the most attention.


Reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving ability


The first researchers in the science of artificial intelligence developed algorithms that simulate the sequential logical reasoning that humans do when solving puzzles, playing backgammon or logical deductions.

In the 1980s and 1990s, artificial intelligence research led to highly successful ways of dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, using concepts from probability and economics.

For difficult problems, most of these algorithms require huge computational resources—resulting in a "combination explosion": the amount of memory or time needed for computers becomes astronomical when the problem exceeds a certain size. The search for algorithms that are more capable of solving problems is a top priority for AI research.
